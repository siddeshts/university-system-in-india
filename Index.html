   <h1>University System in India</h1>
  </center>
</div><br>
India has a publicly funded higher education system that is the third largest in the world, next to the United States and China. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

As per the latest 2011 Census, about 8.15% (98.615 million) of Indians are graduates, with Union Territories of Chandigarh and Delhi topping the list with 24.65% and 22.56% of their population being graduates respectively. Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000-01 to 2010-11. As of 2020, India has over 1000 universities, with a break up of 54 central universities, 416 state universities, 125 deemed universities, 361 private universities and 159 Institutes of National Importance which include AIIMS, IIMs, IIITs, IISERs, IITs and NITs among others. Other institutions include 52,627 colleges as government degree colleges, private colleges, standalone institutes and post-graduate research institutions, functioning under these universities as reported by the MHRD in 2020. Colleges may be Autonomous, i.e. empowered to examine their own degrees, up to PhD level in some cases, or non-autonomous, in which case their examinations are under the supervision of the university to which they are affiliated; in either case, however, degrees are awarded in the name of the university rather than the college.


    <h2>Evolution of universities</h2>
    <p>
        The modern university system in India was started with the establishment of university of Calcutta by the British. Universities of Bombay and Madras followed this. These universities were set up with a clear purpose of developing educated human resources for the British administrative machinery in India. (This is one of the main reasons why, after some debate, English was chosen as the medium of instruction in these universities.)
        
        Although these universities were created mainly with the purpose of education, they did have research programs. Given that they had some outstanding faculty and were perhaps the only places with PhD programs, they emerged as centers for research. In that sense, these were the first research universities in India. Some of the top research universities around the time of independence were the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras, the University of Bombay, Lucknow University, Allahabad University, BHU), Agra University, Punjab University, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and so forth.
        
        However, the focus of these institutions remained as education, which was indeed an important need of the country at the time. The total number of PhDs produced till the 1920s was fewer than one per year, and it was just about three per year in the entire country even in the 30s (the decade before independence). A very senior academician in a prominent university at the time of independence informally mentioned that, as faculty, they were expected to only teach. Some of the talented faculty were involved in research not because they were expected to but because they wanted to, and thankfully, some of the universities had leadership that allowed research to be pursued</p>

    <u><h2>Types of Indian Universities :-</h2></u>

    <h3><a href="C:\html\central.html" target="_main">Central Universities :</a></h3>
    <p>Central universities or union universities in India are public universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education. In general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination.[3] Central universities, in addition, are covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc., and established 12 new universities. As of 31 March 2021, The list of central universities published by the UGC includes 54 central universities.

        Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organisations" or "autonomous institutes". They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education. These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management, the National Law Schools, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and other autonomous institutes</p>

    <h3><a href="C:\html\state.html target="_main"">State Universities :</a></h3>
    <p>State universities are public universities run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India, and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. The University Grants Commission (UGC), draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. The UGC publishes and regularly updates the lists of state universities. As of 4 March 2021, the UGC lists 443 state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai.

        Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also grants the UGC the right to "allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities..."s As such, the UGC categorizes state universities as either "declared fit to receive Central/UGC assistance under Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act-1956", or not, and notes this status at the lists published. Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of the UGC and published in the minutes.[6] The latest list, published by the UGC on 4 March 2022, lists 264 universities as fit to receive Central/UGC assistance</p>
