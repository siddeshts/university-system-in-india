    <h1> Central universities</h1>

    <p>
      Central universities or union universities in India are public
      universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview
      of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education.[1] In
      general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants
      Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants
      Commission Act, 1956.[2] In addition, 15 Professional Councils are
      established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and
      coordination.[3] Central universities, in addition, are covered by the
      Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers,
      governance etc., and established 12 new universities.[4] As of 31 March
      2021, The list of central universities published by the UGC includes 54
      central universities.[5] Apart from the above universities, other
      institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees.
      These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called
      "universities" but "autonomous organisations" or "autonomous institutes".
      They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher
      Education.[6] These organisations include the Indian Institutes of
      Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes
      of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Engineering
      Science and Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management, the National
      Law Schools, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and other
      autonomous institutes.

      Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is a public major research university
      located in New Delhi, India. It was established in 1969 and named after
      Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. The university is known
      for leading faculties and research emphasis on social sciences and applied
      sciences. Jawaharlal Nehru University was established in 1969 by an act of
      parliament. It was named after Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime
      Minister. G. Parthasarathy was the first vice-chancellor.[7] Prof. Moonis
      Raza was the Founder Chairman and Rector.[8][9] The bill for the
      establishment of Jawaharlal Nehru University was placed in the Rajya Sabha
      on 1 September 1965 by the then-Minister of Education, M. C. Chagla.
      During the discussion that followed, Bhushan Gupta, member of parliament,
      voiced the opinion that this should not be yet another university. New
      faculties should be created, including scientific socialism, and one thing
      that this university should ensure was to keep noble ideas in mind and
      provide accessibility to students from weaker sections of society. The JNU
      Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 16 November 1966 and the JNU Act came into
      force on 22 April 1969. The Indian School of International Studies was
      merged with the Jawaharlal Nehru University in June 1970. Following the
      merger, the prefix "Indian" was dropped from the name of the School and it
      became the School of International Studies of the Jawaharlal Nehru
      University.
